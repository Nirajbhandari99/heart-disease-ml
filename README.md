Heart Disease Risk Prediction

Authors: Niraj Bhandari 

Project Type: Machine Learning / Data Science
Language: Python (Jupyter Notebook)

Overview
This project aims to predict the risk of heart disease using machine learning techniques. By analyzing patient data and health indicators, the model can classify whether an individual is at risk of heart disease, helping in early detection and preventive care.

Dataset
The dataset used contains health-related features such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, etc.
Data preprocessing includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
Machine Learning Models
The project explores multiple models including:

Logistic Regression
Random Forest Classifier
Gradient Boosting
K-Nearest Neighbors
Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used to evaluate each model.
